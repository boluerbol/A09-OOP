This is a sample text file for testing WordProcessor. Erbol
It contains some words that will be used to calculate similarity. Erbol ruytyt
Create another class named SimilarityCalculator.

Another text file with different words for similarity comparison. Erbol
This file also has unique words not present in the first file. Erbol

Objective: In this assignment, you will work with Java's Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) concepts to read text from a file, find distinct words,
and calculate a similarity value using a simple formula. Follow these steps
to complete the assignment:

Jaccard Similarity = (Intersection of Set1 and Set2) / (Union of Set1 and Set2)

Calculate the Jaccard similarity between the sets of distinct words obtained from
two different files.

The Jaccard similarity coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no similarity,
 and 1 indicates complete similarity. In other words, the closer the coefficient is to 1,
 the more similar the sets are, and the closer it is to 0, the less similar they are.
